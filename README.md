#**🫀 Coronary Artery Disease Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning**


📋 **Summary**

This study explores the application of machine learning approaches to predict coronary artery disease (CAD), which accounts for nearly 40% of all cardiovascular disease deaths in the United States 🇺🇸. The research demonstrates how ensemble machine learning methods can effectively identify patients at risk for CAD using clinical and diagnostic features.


🔬 **Methodology**

📊 **Dataset**: Used the consolidated UCI Heart Disease dataset (1,109 patient records from 4 medical centers)
🎯 **Features**: 14 clinical variables including age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and exercise stress test parameters
🤖**Models Evaluated**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
⚙️ **Preprocessing**: Applied SMOTE for class balancing, handled missing values, and performed feature scaling
✅ **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

🏆 **Key Results**

🥇 **Best Performance**: Random Forest achieved the highest ROC-AUC of 0.9353, followed by Gradient Boosting (0.9346)
📈**Most Important Features**: ST segment slope, chest pain type, and ST depression emerged as top predictors
🩺 **Clinical Relevance**: Results align with established cardiac diagnostic markers, validating model interpretability
🎯 **High Sensitivity**: All models maintained strong recall (>0.89), crucial for medical screening applications


🏥 C**linical Impact**

The study demonstrates that machine learning can effectively complement traditional cardiovascular risk assessment tools 💊. The identified predictive features correspond to well-established clinical indicators of myocardial ischemia, supporting the potential for real-world clinical implementation.


**⚠️ Limitations & Future Work** 

📊 Dataset limited to CAD outcomes (doesn't include other CVD conditions)
🔗 Potential multicollinearity between ECG-related features not formally assessed
🌍 Need for external validation on larger, more diverse populations
🔮 Recommendation to extend to longitudinal prediction models

This research provides a reproducible framework for cardiovascular risk prediction that could be adapted for broader CVD screening and prevention strategies 🚀.
